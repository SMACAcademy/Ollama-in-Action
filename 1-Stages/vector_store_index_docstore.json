There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange orinterest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or otherinstruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure\nassociated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company\nmay enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair valuehedges.

Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on\ncertain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regardingthe potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking\nstatements can also be identified by words such as \u201cfuture,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cpredicts,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d\u201ccan,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d and similar terms.

Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,\nItem 1A of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 (the \u201c2021 Form 10-K\u201d) under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201dThe Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company\u2019s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months orperiods refer to the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and corporate\ngovernance matters, and details related to the Company\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company\u2019s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holidaydemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\nintroductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a productlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumersand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nQuarterly Highlights\nTotal net sales increased 2% or $1.5 billion during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of\nServices and iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S.dollar had an unfavorable impact on all Products and Services net sales during the third quarter of 2022.\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2022, the Company introduced an all-new MacBook Air and an updated 13-inch MacBook Pro, both powered by the new\nApple M2 chip.
